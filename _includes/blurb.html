  <h1>Hi! I'm Miles</h1>

  <p>I am a carpenter, programmer, and 3D artist who builds tools and shaders for games and digital media. I have a passion for accessibility in gaming (and everywhere else) and a love for making silly projects with friends.</p>
  <p>As an undergrad, I was co-president of TCNJ’s chapter of ACM SIGGRAPH for 2 years, a master carpenter for TCNJ’s theater organizations, and a volunteer at Trenton Animal Shelter.</p>
  <p>I am currently looking for a position in IOS development, 3D modeling or game design.</p>
